		<text>We've got a big problem. The mutants have found a new spot to settle down at, and every day in the Cordon has been getting more and more dangerous with those things around - we just can't let them grow in numbers. You're gonna have to head over there and take out anything you find. Everyone here will be in your debt if you get it done. What do you say?</text>

		<text>Fanatic has asked me to find a Battery artefact for a rookie.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_task_2_fetch_about">
		<text>So, here's the deal. A rookie of ours went to Agroprom recently, all prepared for a merry adventure with a pistol in his right hand and a detector in his left. He scavenged some anomalous area for goodies and ended up finding an artefact. On his way back to the village some army patrol stopped him and took his artefact along with the rest of his stuff - now he's just sitting there, absolutely devastated by what happened. It was his first artefact, and they call it a Battery. I would go look for it myself, but I can't leave the rookies alone - they need some protection, and they've still got a lot to learn. So, will you help him out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_task_2_fetch_finish">
		<text>Ah, you've found a Battery? Excellent. I think the stalker will be happy - I sure don't need him whining and sobbing all day... Gets annoying putting up with all of that. Anyway, thanks for the help.</text>
